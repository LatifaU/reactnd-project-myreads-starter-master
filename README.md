# MyReads Project
To get started developing right away:
* Open Command Prompt on WINDOWS or Terminal on MAC.
* Install all project dependencies using `npm install` command.
* Start the development server build using `npm start` command.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
